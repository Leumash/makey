# makey
makey is a simple shell script to make and execute a program.

## Usage
For easy usage, create an alias in .bashrc file:  
`alias makey=(File Directory)/makey.sh`

Then enter makey in the command line.

## Why
I've noticed that I create a bunch of small programs to test out the functionality of C++. To run and execute those small programs, I've been using the default rules of make to make the program and then execute them.

i.e.  
`make main`  
`main`

Now I can type:  
`makey`
